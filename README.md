# Javascript-3D-Modeling-Program
This is a very basic 3D program made in javascript with the three.js library. When it is finished, you should be able to do basic 3d box-modeling, change the colors of the object, and export the asset.
## Controls:
Arrow keys for orbiting around, and also W, A, S, D for panning around.

# Contributing
I am quite new to **WEBGL** and  **THREE.JS**, so I would be grateful if you were able to contribute, in any way! Before you do, please see if there is anything you could help with in the `issues` section, but if you would prefer to do something else, that's fine.
**Obviously**, you need to fork the repo, change it and do a pull request if you would like to contribute.
